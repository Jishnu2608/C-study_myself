Files are of two types -> program files (.exe) and data files (.txt, .docx etc)

A program is a collection of data and a set of operations or instructions of on that data

*Low level vs High level language*

LL -> machine language, assembly language
HL -> c, c++, python, java etc.



1. Check errors
2. Convert into Machine Code    //if error is there in any line, it will not work and produce the .exe file
3. Execution    //interpreter does this, not compiler

In interpreter, every line is checked line by line and executes it line by line.

Compiler programs are faster
Interpreter languages are easier

Hybrid languages

Java, C#

Byte code by compiler
JVM translates into Machine code by interpreter.

Programming paradigm -- styles

1. Monolithic -- single body code
2. Modular/Procedural -- reusing using functions, main is the manager for functions and structures
3. Object-oriented -- class includes structures and functions in it and defines it and call it to the main
4. Aspect oriented/Component assembly

*Algorithm*

Step by step prodecures for solving computational problems.

*Flowchart*

eclipse -- start/stop
parallelogram -- input/ouput
rectangle -- process
diamond -- condition
arrow -- Flow

Steps for program development and Execution

1. editing
2. compiling
3. linking library
4. loading
5. Execution

for execution, the machine code is loaded into the code section. For variables, it is stored in stack. 
Heap is in middle of code section and stack.


Datatypes -- Numeric and Characters

Primitive datatypes -- primitive, user-defined, derived
primitive -- integral, bool, floating point
             int, char        float, double

userdefined -- enum, structure, union, class
derived -- array, pointer, reference

Size of datatypes

data types  size             range
int         2/4             -32768 to 32767
float       4               -3.4x10^-38 to 3.4x10^38
double      8               -1.7x10^308 to 1.7x10^308
char        1               -128 to 127
bool        undefined       true/false

ASCII codes -- char codes

Modifiers -- unsigned, long

unsigned int -- 0-65535
unsigned char-- 0-255
long int -- 4/8 bytes
long double -- 10 bytes

Operators and expressions

Arithmetic: +,-,*,/,%
Relational: <,>,=,>=,<=
Logical: &&,||,!
Bitwise: &,~,^,
Increment/decrement: ++, --
Assignment: =
